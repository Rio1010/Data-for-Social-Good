# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## Requirements 

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program: 
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors. 
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about. 
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs. 
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset). 
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions. 

## User Story 

Include your User Story you analyzed for your project here. Your User Story should have the following format: 

> As a traveler, <br> 
> I want to know the time and price of local flights, <br> 
> so that I can know the cheapest and most expensive flights. 

## Dataset 

Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type. 

Example: 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sansuthi/global-co2-emissions 
- **Departure** (String) - The airport it leaves from
- **Arrival** (String) - The airport it lands on 
- **Time** (int) - The duration of the flight 
- **Price** (double) - price of the flight

## Description 

This program id for travelelrs to find details abput their local flights. They can find from where the flights going and to where teh destonation if, how long it takes, and how much it costs. The dataset we chose for this project was the FLight Price dateset, providing esensial infromation sucha as the flights schedualing and price. The peogram lists uses an enhanced for loop and prints the each information about the flight and then anotehr for loop to print pit the cheapest and most expensive flight. This way the user can know which flight suits them the most.
